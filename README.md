This Python script is used to extract multiple IP ranges from a large IP range.
It works by giving it a large IP range, and then giving it the range of IPs that you want to be excluded from the first IP range;
The result the script gives you will include all IPs that are in the original range, except for the ranges you entered after it.

Download the [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahdi383ir/mpc/refs/heads/main/exclude-cidrs.py), and run it using Python3.
